//  This proto file is named ".skip" to prevent it from regenerating the "tags_test_objects.pb.go"
//  This file has been modified after it was generated to add the "jsonpb" tags
//  Though this is not possible using the protoc-gen-go tool. Other tools (or people) may modify generated code
//   to add tags that help inform serialization/deserialization.

//  The comment below this was added to the header of that file as well

// ####### THIS CODE WAS MODIFIED BY ADDING THE "jsonpb" tags to the JsonpbTags struct
//  To recreate this file rename 'tags-test-objects.proto.skip' and remove the '.skip' extention, then run 'make regenerate'
// Then add the:
//  jsonpb:"emitdefault"
//  tag to the tags on the EmitDefault field
// and add the:
//  jsonpb:"noemitdefault"
//  tag to the tags on the NoEmitDefault field
//
